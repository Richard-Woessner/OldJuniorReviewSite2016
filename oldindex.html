									<center><p style="width: 90%;">I came to Auburn for IPD because I have always had a fascination with computers. Even when I was 9 I already was working on my grandmaâ€™s old Windows 95 machine that I ruined because of ad viruses. Then when I was around 12, I loved to help people fix their computers no matter the issue because I love to find ways to fix new problems. Then at 16 I built my first computer, her name is Elizabeth, and she is the first time I have ever worked with Hardware and to this day I love to learn more about computers every day and I know if i joined this class it would be easier to learn more while also meeting people who also has the same fasination.  </p> </center>
